# Sort

## 1. Functional Specification

### I. Summary

The purpose of this specification is to add the sort functionality at search time in order to order search results with ease. The so-called `sortable-attributes` fields must be known before the search to be usable. These fields can be of type `string` and `number`. We also introduced a new ranking rule named `sort` which allows the user to adjust how the sorting should behave. Is it more exhaustive or more relevant? It's up to the user. Also we introduce a `sort` parameter on the search endpoints in order to give the end user the ability to sort the search results.

#### Summary Key points

- `sortable-attributes` setting MUST be known by the engine before search time.
- `sort` search parameter MUST be able to operate on multiple fields at search time. `string` or `number`. e.g. sort="price:asc,label:desc,..."
- We add a new ranking rule `sort` which will be computed as soon as the search parameter `sort` is filled in and valid. The `sort` ranking rule allows to adjust the relevancy or the exhaustiveness of the sort.

### II. Motivation

According to our user feedback, the lack of a sorting feature is mentioned as one of the biggest deal-breakers when it comes to choosing MeiliSearch as a search engine. It is critical for a search engine to be able to offer this feature, especially for e-commerce use. Moreover, competitors all offer it. Users today must find workarounds that take time to develop and maintain to be able to sort search results.

We want to offer a simple and versatile solution for their needs.
