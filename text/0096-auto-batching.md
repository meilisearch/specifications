- Title: Auto-Batching

# Auto-Batching

## 1. Summary

Meilisearch can automatically group consecutive asynchronous `documentAddition` or `documentPartial` tasks for the same index via an automatic batching mechanism.

The user can disable this auto-batching behavior. See [3.2. Auto-batching mechanisms options](#32-auto-batching-mechanisms-options) section.

## 2. Motivation

We have regularly collected user pain points pointing out the slow indexing over the last year. We explained several times to users to make batches containing a maximum of documents to be updated/added to compress the indexing time of specific data structures.

To make Meilisearch easier to use, we explored the idea of automatically creating these batches within Meilisearch before indexing usersâ€™ documents.

## 3. Functional Specification

### 3.1. Explanations

A batch preserves the logical order of the tasks for a given index.

Only consecutive `documentAdditionOrUpdate` tasks for the same index can be in the same batch. All `tasks` concerning other operations will also be part of a batch having only one task.

#### 3.1.1. Grouping tasks to a single batch

The scheduling program that groups tasks within a single batch is triggered when an asynchronous `task` currently processed reaches a terminal state as `succeeded` or `failed`.

In other words, when a scheduled `documentAdditionOrUpdate` task for a given index is picked from the task queue, the scheduler fetches and groups all `documentAdditionOrUpdate` tasks for that same index in a batch.

The more similar consecutive tasks the user sends in a row, the more likely the batching mechanism can group these tasks.

##### 3.1.1.1. Schema

##### 3.1.1.2. `batchUid` generation

All tasks are part of a batch identified by an internal `batchUid` field. A task batch preserves the logical order of the tasks for a given index. The batch identifiers are unique and strictly increasing. The `batchUid` field is internal; thus not visible on a `task` resource.

#### 3.1.2. Impacts on `task` API resource

- The different tasks grouped in a batch are processed within the same transaction. But if a task fails within a batch, the whole batch does not fail, only the related task.
- Tasks within the same batch share the same values for the `startedAt`, `finishedAt`, `duration` fields, and the same `error` object if an error occurs for a `task` during the batch processing.
- If a batch contains many `tasks`, the `task` `details` `indexedDocuments` is identical in all `tasks` belonging to the same processed `batch`.

### 3.2. Auto-batching mechanisms options

### 3.2.1. `--disable-auto-batching`

By default, the auto-batching feature is enabled.

The auto-batching feature can be desactivated by passing the command flag `--disable-auto-batching` (or the environment variable `MEILI_DISABLE_AUTO_BATCHING`) to Meilisearch at launch.

## 4. Technical Aspects
N/A

## 5. Future Possibilities

- Extends it for all consecutive payload types.
- Expose the `batchUid` field and add a filter capability on it on the `/tasks` endpoints.
- <s>Do not fail the entire transaction if a document is not valid. Report the documents that could not be indexed to the user.</s>
- <s>Enable auto-batching by default.</s>
- Optimize some tasks sequence, for example if there is a document addition followed by an index deletion, we could skip the document addition.
