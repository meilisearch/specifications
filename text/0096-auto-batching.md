- Title: Auto-Batching

# Auto-Batching

## 1. Summary

Meilisearch can automatically group consecutive asynchronous `documentAddition` or `documentPartial` tasks for the same index via an automatic batching mechanism.

The user can enable this auto-batching behavior through various command flag options.

## 2. Motivation

We have regularly collected user pain points pointing out the slow indexing over the last year. We explained several times to users to make batches containing a maximum of documents to be updated/added to compress the indexing time of specific data structures.

To make Meilisearch easier to use, we explored the idea of automatically creating these batches within Meilisearch before indexing usersâ€™ documents.

## 3. Functional  Specification

### 3.1. Explanations

All `tasks` are part of a batch identified by a `batchUid`. A task batch preserves the logical order of the tasks for a given index.

Only consecutive `documentAddition` and `documentPartial` tasks for the same index can have the same `batchUid`. All `tasks` concerning other operations will also be part of a `batchUid` having only one task.

#### 3.1.1. Grouping tasks to a single batch

The scheduling program that groups tasks within a single batch is triggered when an asynchronous `task` currently processed reaches a terminal state as `succeeded` or `failed`.

In other words, when a scheduled `documentAddition` task for a given index is picked from the task queue, the scheduler fetches and groups all `documentAddition` tasks for that same index in a batch.

The more similar consecutive tasks the user sends in a row, the more likely the batching mechanism can group these tasks.

##### 3.1.1.1. Schema

##### 3.1.1.2. `batchUid` generation

The batch identifiers are unique and strictly increasing.

#### 3.1.2. Impacts on `task` API resource

- The different tasks grouped in a batch are processed within the same transaction. If a task fails within a batch, the whole batch fails.
- A `batchUid` field is only added on fully-qualified `task` API objects. `batchUid` values are unique and strictly increasing.
- Tasks within the same batch share the same values for the `startedAt`, `finishedAt`, `duration` fields, and the same `error` object if an error occurs for a `task` during the batch processing.
- If a batch contains many `tasks`, the `task` `details` `indexedDocuments` is identical in all `tasks` belonging to the same processed `batch`.

### 3.2. Auto-batching mechanisms options

### 3.2.1. `--enable-auto-batching`

By default, the auto-batching feature is disabled.

The auto-batching feature can be activated by passing the command flag `--enable-auto-batching` to Meilisearch at launch.

### 3.2.2.  `--max-batch-size`

`--max-batch-size <NUM>` allows setting the maximum number `NUM` of tasks that can be processed together within a single batch.

If `0` is set it will be replaced by `1`, since such a value would prevent any task from ever being processed.

If not specified, this is unlimited.

### 3.2.3. `--max-documents-per-batch`

`--max-documents-per-batch <NUM>` allows setting a limit to the maximum number `NUM` of documents that can be indexed together within a single batch.

Since the batch can't split one update in half, this value is rounded up to the number of documents in the last document addition.

If not specified, this is unlimited.
### 3.2.4. `--debounce-duration-sec`

`--debounce-duration-sec <SECS>` wait at least `SECS` seconds between the time the scheduler is notified of a new `task` and the processing of the next batch.

Snapshots and dumps are impacted by this debounce duration. It means that they will be processed at the end of the current debounce duration.

Defaults to `0`secs (process immediately).

N/A

## 5. Future Possibilities

- Extends it for all consecutive payload types.
- Add a filter capability by `batchUid` on the `/tasks` endpoints.
- Do not fail the entire transaction if a document is not valid. Report the documents that could not be indexed to the user.
- Enable auto-batching by default.
- Optimize some tasks sequence, for example if there is a document addition followed by an index deletion, we could skip the document addition
