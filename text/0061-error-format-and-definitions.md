- Title: Error Format and Definitions
- Start Date: 2021-08-13
- Specification PR: [#61](https://github.com/meilisearch/specifications/pull/61)

# Error Format

## 1. Functional Specification

### I. Summary

The error format is updated to no longer contain unnecessary `error` prefix terms in the names of these attributes. e.g. `errorType`. The context is clear enough to understand that this is an `error` object.

This specification also serves as a reference point for the complete list of API errors that the user may encounter.

#### Summary Key Points

- `error` is removed from the attributes name and `type`values.
- An exhaustive list of API errors is defined. See Errors List part.

### II. Motivation

The main motivation is to stabilize the current `error` resource to a version that conforms to our API convention and thus allows future evolutions on a more solid base. This specification avoids adding unnecessary information in the error object's attribute names.

The second motivation is to describe in an exhaustive way all the errors that the user may encounter during his use of the API.

### III. Explanation

#### Error Format

##### Attributes

| Field name | type   | Description                                                              |
|------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| message    | string |  A human-readable message providing context and details about the error. |
| code       | string |  A short string indicating the error code reported.                      |
| type       | string |  The type of error returned. `invalid_request`, `internal`, `auth`.       |
| link       | string |  An URL to the related error-page details for further information.       |

##### Json Response Example

e.g. 401 Unauthorized Response example

```
{
    "message": "authorization header is missing",
    "code": "missing_authorization_header",
    "type": "auth",
    "link": "https://docs.meilisearch.com/errors#missing_authorization_header"
}
```

- ðŸ’¡ The error object fields order must conform to the example.

##### type enum

| type            | description                                                                                       |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| invalid_request | This type of error is usually due to a user input error. It is accompanied by an HTTP code `4xx`. |
| internal        | Usually this type of error is returned because the search engine can't perform the operation due to machine or configuration constraints. It can be due to limits being reached such as the size of the disk, the size limit of an index etc.. It can also be an unexpected error. It is accompanied by an HTTP code `5xx`.  |
| auth   | This type of error is returned when it comes to authentication and authorization. It is accompanied by an HTTP code `4xx`. |

#### Error list

Following this format here is the exhaustive list of errors that can be returned by MeiliSearch to an API consumer. This list is updated as MeiliSearch evolves.

ðŸ’¡ Errors returned asynchronously in a `task` object, does not include a definition of the http code.

## 2. Technical details
N/A

## 3. Future Possibilities

- Add a `parameter` attribute in the `error` object to indicate which parameter of the request caused an error.
- Add more specific error types. For example, explode internal errors into several distinct types.
