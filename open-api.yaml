        Meilisearch is an asynchronous API. It means that the API does not behave as you would typically expect when handling the request's responses.

        Some operations are put in a queue and will be executed in turn (asynchronously). In this case, the server response contains the identifier to track the execution of the operation.

  - name: Indexes
    description: |
      An index is an entity that gathers a set of [documents](https://docs.meilisearch.com/learn/core_concepts/documents.html) with its own settings.
      [Learn more about indexes](https://docs.meilisearch.com/learn/core_concepts/indexes.html).
  - name: Documents
    description: |
      Documents are objects composed of fields that can store any type of data.
      Each field contains an attribute and its associated value.
      Documents are stored inside [indexes](https://docs.meilisearch.com/learn/core_concepts/indexes.html).
      [Learn more about documents](https://docs.meilisearch.com/learn/core_concepts/documents.html).
  - name: Search
    description: |
      Meilisearch exposes 3 routes to perform document searches:
      * A POST route: this is the preferred route when using API authentication, as it allows [preflight request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Preflight_request) caching and better performances.
      * A GET route: the usage of this route is discouraged, unless you have good reason to do otherwise (specific caching abilities for example).
      Other than the differences mentioned above, the two routes are strictly equivalent.
      * A POST multi-search route allowing to perform multiple search queries in a single HTTP request.
      Meilisearch exposes 1 route to perform facet searches:
      * A POST facet-search route allowing to perform a facet search query on a facet in a single HTTP request.
  - name: Tasks
    description: |
      The `tasks` route gives information about the progress of the [asynchronous operations](https://docs.meilisearch.com/learn/advanced/asynchronous_operations.html).
  - name: Keys
    description: |
      Manage API `keys` for a Meilisearch instance. Each key has a given set of permissions.
      You must have the master key or the default admin key to access the `keys` route.
      [More information about the keys and their rights](https://docs.meilisearch.com/reference/features/security.html).
  - name: Settings
    description: |
      `Settings` is a list of all the __customization__ possible for an index.
      It is possible to update all the settings in one go or individually with the dedicated routes. Updates in the settings route are __partial__. This means that any parameters not provided in the body will be left unchanged.
      Updating the settings means overwriting the default settings of Meilisearch. You can reset to default values using the `DELETE` routes.
  - name: Stats
    description: |
      `Stats` gives extended information and metrics about indexes and the Meilisearch database.
  - name: Health
    description: |
      The health check endpoint enables you to periodically test the health of your Meilisearch instance.
  - name: Version
    description: |
      Current version of Meilisearch.
  - name: Dumps
    description: |
      The `dumps` route allows the creation of database dumps. Dumps are `.dump` files that can be used to launch Meilisearch. Dumps are compatible between Meilisearch versions.
      Creating a dump is also referred to as exporting it, whereas launching Meilisearch with a dump is referred to as importing it.
      During a [dump export](https://docs.meilisearch.com/reference/api/dump.html#create-a-dump), all indexes of the current instance are exported—together with their documents and settings—and saved as a single `.dump` file.
      During a dump import, all indexes contained in the indicated `.dump` file are imported along with their associated documents and settings. Any existing index with the same uid as an index in the dump file will be overwritten.
      Dump imports are [performed at launch](https://docs.meilisearch.com/reference/features/configuration.html#import-dump) using an option.
  - name: Snapshots
    description: |
      The `snapshots` route allows the creation of database snapshots. Snapshots are `.snapshot` files that can be used to launch Meilisearch.
      Creating a snapshot is also referred to as exporting it, whereas launching Meilisearch with a snapshot is referred to as importing it.
      During a snapshot export, all indexes of the current instance are exported—together with their documents and settings—and saved as a single `.snapshot` file.
      During a snapshot import, all indexes contained in the indicated `.snapshot` file are imported along with their associated documents and settings.
      Snapshot imports are performed at launch using an option.
  - name: Experimental
    description: |
      The `experimental-features` endpoint allows enabling and disabling [experimental features](https://github.com/meilisearch/engine-team/blob/main/resources/experimental-features.md) at runtime.
      Experimental features are features that are not yet covered by [Meilisearch's stability guarantee](https://github.com/meilisearch/engine-team/blob/main/resources/versioning-policy.md) and that could break between minor and patch Meilisearch versions.

                        overview: "The Bridge of San Luis Rey is American author Thornton Wilder's second novel, first published in 1927 to worldwide acclaim. It tells the story of several interrelated people who die in the collapse of an Inca rope-fiber suspension bridge in Peru, and the events that lead up to their being on the bridge.[ A friar who has witnessed the tragic accident then goes about inquiring into the lives of the victims, seeking some sort of cosmic answer to the question of why each had to die. The novel won the Pulitzer Prize in 1928."

        To add your own ranking rule, you have to communicate either `asc` for ascending order or `desc` for descending order followed by the field name in brackets.

        * To apply an ascending custom ranking rule: `attribute_name:asc`
        * To apply a descending custom ranking rule: `attribute_name:desc`
